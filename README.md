# How to Render a Directed Graph

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Which tool should we pick to render a JSON-Graph like structure, given the following requirements:

* Renders a JSON-Graph like structure
* Allows customization of nodes, edges and edge labels
* Has zooming and panning (by user input and programmatically)
* Allows for easy graph traversal (i.e. highlight edges from node to node)
* Is lightweight (low bundle size)
* Is fast enough (rendering, zooming, panning, etc)
* Plays well with React

Considered tools:

1. [React JSON Graph](https://github.com/antonKalinin/react-json-graph)
1. [Cytoscape](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js)
1. [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3)
1. [React Diagrams](https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams/)
1. [React Digraph](https://github.com/uber/react-digraph)
1. [Cola.js](http://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/)
1. [Dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre)
